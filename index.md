## Welcome aaron-tay.github.io

I'm a full-stack software engineer with experiences throughout the entire web stack.

### About me 
I enjoy drinking tea (Houji-cha is my favourite) and eating Japanese food (especially Tonkatsu!). Occasionally I indulge in sak√©, but can't have too much as it makes me go red *blush* :P

### What I know

I have experience working with early-stage start-ups from pre-conception to product ideation into early stage maturity. It's been a fantastic journey learning about the delicate balances amongst engineering, product, marketing and sales. The primary industry has been food and drinks and the service industry.

There's been plenty of opportunities for me over the years to work with numerous technologies along the web stack going as deep down as database schema and queries, through to RESTful APIs and server fleet deployment and management using automated builds and deployment, cross platform client-side front end applications up to business level user tracking and analytics.
